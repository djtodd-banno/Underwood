    /*Since JavaWriter is very very popular there are many other processors, libraries and tools
     depending on JavaWriter. This maybe will cause problems if you use dependency management tools
     like maven or gradle if one library depends on a newer version of JavaWriter as another one.
     Therefore I recommend to copy and repackage JavaWriter directly into your annotation processor
     code base (itâ€™s just one java file).*/
